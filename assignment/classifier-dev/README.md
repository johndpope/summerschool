# JSALT Tutorial: Sentence Representation

---

### Overview

This assignment consists of three notebooks:
* [Prelude](Prelude.ipynb), introducing basic text processing for ML. No work,
  but you'll need this information for the rest of the assignment so read it carefully!
* [Exploration](Exploration.ipynb), in which we'll introduce the Stanford 
  Sentiment Treebank (SST) and train a baseline Naive Bayes model.
* [Neural Bag of Words Model](NeuralBOW.ipynb), in which you'll implement and train a Neural 
  Bag-of-Words model on the SST.

This assignment builds directly on the [TensorFlow Introduction](../a1/tensorflow/tensorflow.ipynb) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html), which we'll be using to manage the datasets.
